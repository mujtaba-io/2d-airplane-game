A simple side-scrolling endless shooting game made in Godot engine for a [basic game development tutorial](https://gameidea.org/2024/10/05/making-2d-airplane-shooter-game-in-godot/). The tutorial aims to teach basics of 2D space, rigid bodies, spawning of objects, how some mechanics are made such as simple shooting, collecting coins, updating UI with fresh values, destroying objects, parallax backgrounds that scroll infinitely, and so on. The theory aims at telling the techniques and the actual code is written in GDScript for Godot engine.
